## Section 3: Conditional Statements  
1. Take a number and check if it's positive, negative, or zero.  
1. Take a number and check if it's divisible by 5 and 11.  
1. Input 3 numbers and print the greatest and the smallest among them.  
1. A shop offers a discount of 10% if purchase amount > 1000. Ask user for amount and print final payable amount.  
1. Input marks of a student and print the grade as per:  
```  
    >=90: A  
    >=80: B  
    >=70: C  
    >=60: D  
    <60: Fail  
```  
1. Check whether a character is a vowel or consonant.

## Section 5: Number Manipulation and Digit Problems  
1. Check whether a number is a palindrome (e.g., 121, 1331).  
1. Count how many even and odd digits are present in a number.  
1. Calculate the sum of digits of a number until it becomes a single digit (digital root).  
1. Check whether a number is Armstrong (e.g., 153 = 1³+5³+3³).  
1. Print the sum of squares of digits of a number.  
1. Input a number and count how many times each digit (0–9) appears.  
1. Convert a decimal number to binary manually (no bin() function).  
1. Find the product of all digits in a number.  
1. Input a number and print whether it is a perfect number (sum of factors equals the number).  
1. Check if a number is a strong number (sum of factorials of digits = original number).
